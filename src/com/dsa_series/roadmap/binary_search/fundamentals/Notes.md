# Binary Search

For binary search we can think of both an iterative and a recursive solution.

# Lower Bound
Definition : Smallest index such that the nums[index] >= target
The lower bound algorithm finds the first or the smallest index in a sorted array where the value at that index is greater than or equal to a given key i.e. x.

# Upper Bound 
Definition : Smallest index such that the nums[index] > target
The upper bound algorithm finds the first or the smallest index in a sorted array where the value at that index is greater than a given key i.e. x
