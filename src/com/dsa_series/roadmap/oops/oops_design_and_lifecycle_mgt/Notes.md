# Liskov Substituition Principle
- Subtypes should be substitutible for their base types without affecting the correctness 
of the program

# Interface Segregation Principle
- A class should not be forced to implement interfaces it does not use

# Dependency Inversion Principle
- High level modules should not be dependent on low level modules. Both should depend on abstractions.
