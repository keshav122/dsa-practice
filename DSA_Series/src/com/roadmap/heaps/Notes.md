** Priority Queues are one of the most common usages of Heaps. **

# Heap

A **heap** is a special tree-based data structure that satisfies the **heap property**. It is commonly used to efficiently solve problems involving **priority** and to implement algorithms like **sorting** and finding the **smallest or largest elements**.

## Heap Property

The heap property defines the relationship between a **parent node** and its **child nodes** in a heap. This property ensures that the structure of the heap remains consistent for efficient operations. The exact nature of this relationship depends on the type of heap. There are two types of heaps:

### Min-Heap
- The value of each **parent node** must be **less than or equal to** the values of its **child nodes**.
- This ensures that the **smallest element** is always at the **root of the heap**.

### Max-Heap
- The value of each **parent node** must be **greater than or equal to** the values of its **child nodes**.
- This ensures that the **largest element** is always at the **root of the heap**.

### 🔹 Key Points about the Heap Property:

1. **Local Relationship:**
   - The heap property only ensures that a **parent node** maintains its relationship with its **immediate children**.
   - It does not impose any **order between sibling nodes** or across levels.

2. **Preservation During Operations:**
   - When elements are **inserted or removed**, the **heap property** might temporarily be violated.
   - A process called **heapification** restores the property by adjusting the positions of elements.

## Internal Representation of Heap

The internal implementation of a **heap** utilizes the **array representation** rather than the tree structure discussed earlier. This highlights the importance of understanding how an **almost complete binary tree** is represented using an **array**.

### 📌 Indexing Technique to Represent the Tree

- **Root Node:** The root of the tree is stored at **index `0`** (following **0-based indexing**).
- **Parent-Child Relationships:** For a node at index `i`:
  - **Left Child:** The left child is located at index `2*i + 1`.
  - **Right Child:** The right child is located at index `2*i + 2`.
  - **Parent:** The parent is located at index `⌈i/2⌉ - 1`.

### 📌 Example Conversion:

#### Indices of **Leaf Nodes** and **Non-leaf Nodes**

##### 🍃 Leaf Nodes
- Leaf nodes are the **nodes without any children**, and they always appear in the **last level** (or partially in the **second-last level** if the last level is incomplete).
- In an **array representation** of a binary tree with `N` elements:
  - **Range of Leaf Node Indices:** Leaf Nodes start from the index `⌊N/2⌋` to `N-1` (both inclusive).

##### 🌳 Non-leaf Nodes
- Non-leaf nodes are the **nodes that have at least one child**.
- In an **array representation** of a binary tree with `N` elements:
  - **Range of Non-leaf Node Indices:** Non-leaf Nodes start from the index `0` to `⌊N/2⌋ - 1` (both inclusive).
