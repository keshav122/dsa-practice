# This will contain basic theoretical introduction about the topic/data structure and any special logic that we need to remember for this topic

Tree : Tree as a data structure allows storing /representing data present in hierarchical format. For example if you have to store the folder structure or the relationships present in a family for multiple generations we can use the tree data structure.


Types of Binary Trees
Full Binary Tree: Each node has either 0 or 2 children, ensuring a structured and predictable layout for traversal and insertion.
Complete Binary Tree: All levels are fully filled except possibly the last, where nodes are left-aligned. Optimized for efficient storage and access.
Perfect Binary Tree: A fully balanced tree where all leaf nodes are at the same level, maximizing space utilization.
Balanced Binary Tree: Height difference between subtrees is minimal, preventing skewed structures and ensuring efficient operations.
Degenerate Tree: Nodes form a linear chain like a linked list, leading to inefficient searches due to imbalance.
