Sorting

# Selection sort :
The idea is that we select the minimum out of the array and place it at its correct position.  We repeat this for n-1 times and the array should be sorted.

Steps :
Select the starting index of the unsorted part using a loop with 'i' from 0 to n-1

Find the smallest element in the range from 'i+1' to n-1 using an inner loop.

Swap this smaller element with the index at i
Repeat the process for the next starting index.
